# Barebones RPG Monsters and NPCs Creation

Greetings, fellow players!
It's been a while since my last post. This guide will help you create NPCs and monsters for your Barebones RPG session. We'll delve into the categories, hit dice, dice rolls, and abilities, covering the essentials for bringing monsters and enemies to life in Barebones RPG. GMs can use dice like d4, d8, d10, and d12 for number-appearing creatures or monsters.

## Monster Encounter, Reaction, and Surprise rules. 

### Encounter

The GM will roll for an encounter using a six-sided die, and depending on the biome, environment, and how noisy the players are while exploring a dungeon, it may increase the chance of them encountering a wandering monster. 

The typical chance of encountering a wandering monster is 1-in-6. 

A Die Encounter is rolled. Whenever a one is rolled, an encounter will always happen. The GM will then roll for a Number Appearing, Reaction (if is not obvious for the GM), and Surprise rolls. This should give an idea of how many monsters are in the area, how it will react toward the players, and if the Monsters or the Players are surprised.

### Monster Reaction
| 2d6   | Result                  |
|-------|-------------------------|
| 2     | Kill the PCs            |
| 3–5   | Hostile, may attack |
| 6–8   | Uncertain, confused |
| 9–11  | Indifferent, may negotiate |
| 12 or more  | Eager, friendly|
 
### Surprise Roll
- Monsters: The referee rolls for monsters.
- PCs: One player rolls for the adventuring party as a whole.

**Results:** _A result of **1 or 2** means the side is surprised_.

### The Effects of Surprise
- **Both Sides Surprised:** There is simply a momentary confusion—neither side has any advantage.

- **One Side Surprised:** The side that is not surprised gains a one-round advantage. The surprised side cannot act during that round.

## Morale
Morale is determined after the initiative roll. Enemies check their morale when they reach half their HP or lose their leader. The GM rolls 2d6 to ascertain the enemy's reaction and actions.

## Converting OSR to Barebones RPG

### Hit Die | HD
The Game Master should be familiar with the Hit Die. Most OSRs are rolled with a d8. However, in Barebones, the GM can roll with a d6 or use the average roll of a d6 (3 due to rounding down) multiplied by the number on HD. In our zine, we assign each monster an average roll and then add a base bonus based on the category to which the monster belongs.

### No Save or Check rolls for Monsters | S/C
Monsters in BBRPG don't have any Save or Check rolls; they automatically perform their abilities. However, players must roll with a burden for this save. The monsters in BBRPG have evolved to be inherently dangerous. Nevertheless, if players have retainers or NPCs, they do have to make **Save or Check** rolls, with the GM using (n) HD for these rolls.

## Armor | Arm
Certain monsters will wear or possess some form of natural armor. For some, it's simpler to calculate armor by adding the base and their HD, then dividing the total by 2. If the result is n.5, round it up. For example, with 2 bases + 2 HD = 4/2, the monster will have -d2 armor. In contrast, for certain enemies or monsters, if the result is 1, the monster will have an armor value of 1, subtracting incoming damage by 1.

## Attack | Att
A monster can attack up to n times and then add a feature or a weapon. Utilize the weapon information from the cheat sheet or zine. The monster's weapon will be in the Weapon Tag + (n) HD damage format. If the GM plays as an NPC, they can use the Weapon tag + 1 damage for untrained NPCs. For battle-trained NPCs, use the Weapon tag + 2 damage. Remember that some monsters will have 1-1 HD; in such cases, use the base as the HD.

## Ability | Abi
Is an unique trait that a monster or NPC possesses. These abilities can have various effects and are often used to distinguish one creature from another. These abilities can include special attacks, resistances, vulnerabilities, or other unique traits that make the monster stand out. Players will typically roll with a burden against monster abilities, indicating that there might be additional challenges or consequences associated with these traits.

### Description:

The Vile Sporefiend is a grotesque creature, resembling a twisted combination of plant and insect. Its body is covered in slimy, toxic spores that exude a nauseating odor. The creature moves with surprising agility, using its noxious tentacles to strike at unsuspecting prey.

### Behavior:

Vile Sporefiends are often found lurking in damp, dark environments, waiting for potential victims to approach. When threatened, they unleash their toxic cloud as a last-ditch effort to harm those around them.

### Tactics:

In battle, the Vile Sporefiend relies on its Noxious Tentacles to deliver quick and poisonous strikes. The toxic cloud serves as both a defensive mechanism and a means of deterring attackers. Caution is advised when facing these creatures, as their insidious nature can catch even seasoned adventurers off guard.

## NPC Creation 

Players will encounter countless characters; some will be brave or foolish to fight with or against your playable characters. I love to keep things simple. If a character is a regular citizen who has never adventured outside their village or city, then the character should have 1 all across the board. If it is a merchant or someone who goes out of the village and travels quite a bit, give that NPC a 2 all across the board. If it is a battle-trained NPC, then a 3 should be the number to go with. Just roll or give the average number you assigned to the NPC Hit Die to generate HP.

**NPC Example:**

|Name| Urigin Swiftfoot|
|:---|:---|
|Heritage/Race:| Halfling|
|HP|12|
|MIGHT| 2|
|MOBILITY| 2|
|INSIGHT| 2|
|GRIT| 2|
|ESSENCE| 2|
|Armor| Rag Clothing (No Burden on Might and Mobility check, or save)|
|Attack| Dagger, 1 + (MIGHT) _dmg_|
|Ability| Due to Halfling’s small stature, they will roll with a boost for any defense and mobility check or save rolls.|
|Holding| 80 coins|

This NPC character will react depending on the reaction roll of a d6. A GM or Player can make this roll.

|Roll|Result|
|:---:|:---:|
|1-2|Hostile|
|3|Negative|
|4|Uncertain|
|5|Positive|
|6|Friendly|
